            <h2>Missile Man of India</h2>
            <p><b>Dr. A.P.J. Abdul Kalam</b>, known as the "Missile Man of India," was a renowned scientist and the 11th President of India. Born on October 15, 1931, in Rameswaram, Tamil Nadu, he made significant contributions to India's ballistic missile and nuclear weapons programs. Kalam's work as a scientist at the Defence Research and Development Organisation (DRDO) and Indian Space Research Organisation (ISRO) played a pivotal role in India's Pokhran-II nuclear tests in 1998. Beyond his scientific achievements, he was deeply loved and respected for his educational and inspirational efforts, particularly among the youth of India. His presidency, from 2002 to 2007, was marked by his approachability and the vision he had for transforming India into a developed nation by 2020. Dr. Kalam's life story, from humble beginnings to becoming a national icon, continues to inspire millions across the globe.</p>
